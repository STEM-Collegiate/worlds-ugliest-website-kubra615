    <header><h1 class="head">Pop Quiz Nightmare</h1>
    <p class="font2">You walk in smiling, then the teacher whispers “pop quiz.” Suddenly, your notebook is empty, your memory is gone, and your classmates’ panic is contagious. 
The room gets colder, pencils start shaking, and even the clock seems to laugh at you. 
You write random answers hoping for a miracle, but deep down you know—this quiz is here to destroy your GPA and your soul at the same time.</p>

<p class="font">A pop quiz always arrives when you least expect it. You’re relaxed, maybe even doodling in your notebook, and suddenly the teacher says those magic words. Instantly, the whole class groans in despair.</p>

<p class="font">Your heart races as papers land on your desk. You flip the page and realize you’ve never seen half of the questions before. Panic spreads like wildfire, and even the smartest student looks lost.</p>

<p class="font">The worst part of a pop quiz is the silence. Everyone is scratching their heads, chewing pencils, and trying to remember what was taught three months ago. The classroom feels like a haunted library full of stressed ghosts.</p>

<p class="font">When it’s over, relief never comes. The teacher smiles and says, “That was just a practice quiz.” Just a practice? No, it was psychological warfare. Pop quizzes are the ultimate betrayal of school life.</p>
