<h1 id="fix">The Torture of Waking Up Early</h1>
<p class="font">Alarms are evil. Your bed hugs you tighter than any teacher ever will.
     Even coffee looks at you like “good luck, buddy.”
     Mornings are basically a battle for survival.</p>

<p class="font2">Waking up at 6 a.m. feels like punishment. Your body is still asleep, but the alarm clock doesn’t care. You walk around like a zombie, trying to find your backpack and your brain at the same time.</p>

<p class="font2">Going to school without enough rest is the worst. You sit in class, your eyes half closed, and every word from the teacher sounds like a lullaby. Concentration? Impossible.</p>

<p class="font2">Some mornings you don’t even eat breakfast because there’s no time. You run to catch the bus, and of course it’s either way too early or already gone. Classic school chaos.</p>

<p class="font2">By the time you finally sit at your desk, you already feel like you’ve survived a war. And then the teacher says: “Take out your homework.” Horrible school life never takes a break.</p>
