      <h2 id="fix">Why the Horrible school life?</h2>
      <p class="font">School life is supposed to be fun and exciting, but sometimes it feels more like a survival game. From waking up at terrible hours to endless exams,
         every day brings a new challenge that makes students sigh loudly.</p>
      <p class="font">Instead of adventure and joy, the dreaded school life gives us mountains of homework, surprise exams, and boring lectures. Students become professional warriors
         against stress, fatigue, and poor grades.</p>
      <p class="font">Everyone talks about “the best years of your life,” but let’s be honest—sometimes school life is more like a comedy horror movie. You laugh, you cry, you panic,
         and somehow you still have to wake up and do it all again tomorrow.</p>
