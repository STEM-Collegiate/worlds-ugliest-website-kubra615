    <h1>Teachers “Surprise” Projects</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
<p class="font3">Teachers love surprises… for them. You get a project due tomorrow, 
and somehow, it feels harder than climbing Mount Everest with one hand tied behind 
your back. The worst part? They always say, “It’s just a small project, don’t worry.”</p>

<p class="font3">But that “small” project needs research, a poster, a presentation, and maybe even a time machine to finish it in one night. Suddenly, you’re bargaining with your printer, praying it won’t run out of ink at midnight. And of course, the glue stick disappears the exact moment you actually need it.</p>

<p class="font3">Meanwhile, you’re texting your friends in a panic: “Do you have extra markers? Can you print this for me? Help!” Every minute counts, and suddenly your room looks like a craft explosion—papers everywhere, scissors under the bed, and sticky notes clinging to walls like a desperate attempt at motivation.
And all you can think is: “Why didn’t I start this earlier?”</p>
